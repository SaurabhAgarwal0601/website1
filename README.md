# website1
This code is of a website which was on Param Goswami,myself.
It is a 3 page website,which was mainly focussed on displaying the things i understood during the study of web development and less on the content.
A 3rd party library font awesome is also used in some places.
This code was run when i put the css files in one folder named css and all the font awesome files in a folder named fonts.
